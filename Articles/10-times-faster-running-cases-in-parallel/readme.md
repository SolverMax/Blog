## 10 times faster, running cases in parallel
In this article, we explore running optimization model cases in parallel. Specifically, we use the Python multiprocessing and mpi4py libraries to fully use the many CPU cores/threads in modern computers.

Our goals are to:
- Illustrate how to apply the multiprocessing and mpi4py libraries to running optimization model cases in parallel.
- Measure the performance of running cases in parallel compared with serially.
- Compare the performance of an old 4 core / 4 thread CPU with a new 20 core / 28 thread CPU, using the HiGHS solver.
