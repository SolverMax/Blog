## Green manufacturing via cutting patterns
In this article we replicate a wood-cutting model from a published academic paper, "An application of cutting-stock problem in green manufacturing: A case study of wooden pallet industry". A key motivation of the case study is the minimization of waste, as a means of reducing the manufacturer's environmental impact.

The paper's model is built in Excel and solved using OpenSolver, so we do the same. More importantly, the paper illustrates a useful pattern selection technique for formulating and solving large one-dimensional cutting problems.

We focus on replicating the paper's model â€“ though, surprisingly, we obtain a better result.
