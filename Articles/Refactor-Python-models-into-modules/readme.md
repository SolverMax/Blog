## Refactor Python models into modules
In this article we explore two aspects of working with multiple variations of a model:
- Modularization. We refactor an existing model into modules, consisting of functions located in separate files.
- Adding models. We extend the existing model by adding variations that make efficient use of the modular structure.

Along the way, we look at shallow vs deep copying in Python. This is a topic that often causes subtle bugs, so it is important to understand when working with variations of a model.
