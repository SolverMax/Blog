## Well, that escalated quickly
In this series of articles, we look at a simple situation that requires deciding the best order for positioning devices in a rack.

We use four methods for solving this problem:
- Model 1. Enumerate all possible position orders.
- Model 2. Search randomly for a specified time.
- Model 3. Local search for a specified time.
- Model 4. Constraint programming using OR-Tools.
- Model 5. Mixed integer linear programming using Pyomo.
