## Warehouse optimization
In this article series we explore optimization of a "picking warehouse" â€“ that is, a warehouse where we pick items off the shelves to fulfil a customer order.
As a result, we improve the efficiency of our warehouse by a factor of three.

Specifically, we model the efficiency of:
- A variety of shelving layout designs.
- Positioning items on shelves according to order probability.
- Combining orders to achieve economies of scale.

The model is built in Python, using the OR-Tools and networkx libraries..
