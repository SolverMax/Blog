## On the shoulders of giants
Designing an optimization model can be difficult. In seeking guidance, we often look for inspiration from the published academic literature. Since the 1950s, there has been an enormous amount of research into how to design and solve optimization models for a wide range of situations, with models for just about anything we could want.

There is much that we can learn from the literature, if only we could understand it. Many academic papers include a statement of the model's design, known as the formulation, using mathematical notation that can look impenetrable. The notation is seldom explained, so translating a formulation into a working model can be a perplexing and frustrating process.

But with a little knowledge about what the notation means, we can gain a lot of insight into how to design or improve our models. The purpose of this article is to explain the meaning of common mathematical notation and illustrate how we can apply the knowledge contained in academic papers to help us build working models in Excel.
