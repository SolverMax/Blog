## Optimal but not practical
We address a common modelling issue: The solution is optimal, but not practical.

In this series of articles, we use a variety of techniques to create several models. Along the way, we address the trade-off between our quantitative and qualitative objectives, enabling the decision maker to make an informed decision to implement an efficient and practical solution.

The models are built in Python using the Pyomo optimization library. We use local solvers and solvers on NEOS Server to solve the models
