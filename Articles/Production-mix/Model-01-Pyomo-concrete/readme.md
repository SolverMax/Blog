## Production mix - Model 1, Pyomo
In this article we build Model 1 of the Python Production mix series, using the Pyomo library.

The Production mix model relates to our hypothetical boutique pottery business, which is described in more detail in the article Python optimization Rosetta Stone.

Our objective for this article is to build and explain the workings of a simple Pyomo example.

Although Model 1 is like many examples of a Pyomo model that you may find on the web and in textbooks, it certainly does not represent best (or even good) practice. In subsequent articles, we'll incrementally improve the model, leading to a structure that is more suitable for operational models.

Even so, Model 1 is an easy-to-understand place to start our exploration of building optimization models in Python. It is worth understanding this model before moving on to more sophisticated versions.
