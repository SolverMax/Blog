## Production mix - Model 11, SciPy

In this article we continue the Python Production mix series, using the SciPy library.

Specifically, we build Model 11, which:

- Builds the model using the SciPy library.
- Reads the data from a json file.

There is a close similarity between this SciPy model and our Pyomo models. Although the syntax of the two libraries is somewhat different, the general structure of the model definitions and solution process is familiar.
