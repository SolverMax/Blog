## Production mix - Model 8, OR-Tools

In this article we continue the Python Production mix series, using the OR-Tools library.

Specifically, we build Model 8, which:

- Builds the model using the OR-Tools library.
- Reads the data from a json file.

There is a close similarity between this OR-Tools model and our Pyomo models. Although the syntax of the two libraries is somewhat different, the general structure of the model definitions and solution process is familiar.
