## Production mix - Model 10, CVXPY

In this article we continue the Python Production mix series, using the CVXPY library.

Specifically, we build Model 10, which:

- Builds the model using the CVXPY library.
- Reads the data from a json file.

There is a close similarity between this CVXPY model and our Pyomo models. Although the syntax of the two libraries is somewhat different, the general structure of the model definitions and solution process is familiar.
