## Efficient jury empanelling
In this article, we describe a simulation model of the jury selection process. The goal is to explore how the needs of the justice system can be met while also respecting the time of people who report for jury service.

We have two simulation models:
- Model 1. A pure Python model of the process.
- Model 2. Using the SimPy library.
