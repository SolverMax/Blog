## Schedule staff with enumerated shifts
A common application of optimization modelling is the scheduling of staff to meet demand. Scheduling problems can be difficult to solve, as there are often very specific requirements that need to be met, including staff availability, working hours, break times, etc.

One approach for formulating scheduling problems is to enumerate all possible shift patterns and then decide how many of each shift pattern to use so that we meet the various constraints at least cost.

In these blog articles we implement a staff scheduling model using two tools:
- Excel, using the CBC solver via OpenSolver.
- Python, using the CBC solver via Pyomo.
