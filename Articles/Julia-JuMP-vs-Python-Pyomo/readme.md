## Julia/JuMP vs Python/Pyomo
In this article we develop an optimization model in the Julia programming language, using the JuMP mathematical optimization package.

Our objectives are to:
- Write a linear programming model using Julia/JuMP.
- Compare the model with an equivalent model written using Python/Pyomo.

Although Julia/JuMP is not yet widely used outside universities, we expect that it will become an important tool for optimization modelling over the next few years.
