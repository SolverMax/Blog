## Permission granted: A role mining model
In this article, we implement a recently published role mining model.

The paper's authors claim that their new model formulation is both tractable and practical, allowing real world data sets to be solved in a reasonable amount of time. Like the authors of that paper, we build both constraint programming (CP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models, then compare their relative performance while solving several examples.
