## Running up the wrong hill
We explore some aspects of solver behaviour when solving non-linear optimization models.

Our goal is to provide insights into what the solvers are doing, why they may find different solutions, and how we can improve our chances of finding at least a good, and hopefully a globally optimal, solution.

The model is built in Python using Pyomo.
