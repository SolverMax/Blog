## Locational marginal pricing of potatoes
In this article, we apply Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) to the supply of potatoes to fast-food restaurants.

Our goal is to provide the restaurants' suppliers and contractors with price signals to incentivize efficient bahaviour. This goal is essentially the same as a more common application of LMP: pricing in electricity markets.
The method is much the same too. That is, the locational marginal prices are calculated by the linear program solver as the "dual values" on the node balance constraints.

We describe the optimization model and calculation of the LMPs. We then explore several scenarios for how the suppliers and contractors may respond to the LMP signals.
