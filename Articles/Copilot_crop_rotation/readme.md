## Crop rotation: Can AI code an entire optimization model?
In this article we pursue an ambitious goal: Create an entire, non-trivial optimization model using Artificial Intelligence (AI).

We report our experience of using Copilot to write a model for us. Rather than presenting a verbatim transcript, which is very long, we focus on what went well and what didn't go well as the model evolves. We also summarize general lessons from the process.
