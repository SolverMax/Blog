## Objectives matter: Sorting using a MIP model
In this article, we assess the impact of using an alternative objective function in a model that sorts input parameters.

The idea is to give the HiGHS solver greater traction while working through the solution space, hopefully helping it to solve the model faster. We've found this technique to be useful for some other models â€“ will it help in this situation?
