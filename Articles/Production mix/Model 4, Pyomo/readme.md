## Production mix - Model 4, Pyomo
In this article we continue the Python Production mix series, using the Pyomo library.

Specifically, we build Model 4, which changes Model 3 to:
- Import the data from an external json file.
- Read the data into the Model object, rather than into separate objects.

These changes reflect features that we may need to include in an operational model.
