## Production mix - Model 3, Pyomo
In this article we continue the Python Production mix series, using the Pyomo library.

Specifically, we build Model 3, which changes Model 2 by:
- Extracting the data from the model, and putting it in an external file.
- Implementing better handling of the solve process.
- Expanding the output to include additional information.

Each of these improvements are important steps in developing a practical design that can be used for operational models.
