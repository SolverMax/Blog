## Production mix - Model 5, Pyomo
In this article we continue the Python Production mix series, using the Pyomo library.

Specifically, we build Model 5, which changes Model 4 to:
- Define the constraints and objective function using def function blocks.
- Output the slack values and dual prices (also known as shadow prices) for each constraint.

These changes give us more control over how the model is defined and provide more information about the solution.
