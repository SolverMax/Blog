## Job sequencing to minimize completion time
"Job sequencing" is a common management problem, especially in manufacturing and production businesses.

That is, given a set of jobs, what is the job sequence that takes the minimum total time?

The benefits from improved sequencing can be substantial, while a poor sequencing solution can be expensive. To illustrate how an optimization model can help us make the decision, in this article we solve a simple job sequencing problem using Solver.
