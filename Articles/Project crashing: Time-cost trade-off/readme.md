## Project crashing: Time-cost trade-off
Project crashing is the process of compressing a project plan by using additional resources to reduce the duration of some tasks.

Using additional resources incurs additional cost, so it is important that the resources are deployed to the tasks that produce the greatest benefit. A project manager must decide an appropriate trade-off between time and cost for each task, leading to the best revised project plan. Given the dependencies between project tasks, making these trade-offs can be complex and difficult, even for a small project.

This article describes an example of project crashing using an optimization model to help the project manager decide what to do.
